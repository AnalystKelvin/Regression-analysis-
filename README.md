# Regression-analysis-
Predictive Analysis Using Multiple Regression in Excel.

I wanted to predict the cost for A,B and C products of producing the following...
1,200 pieces of Product A
800 pieces of product B
1,000 pieces of product C.
I used the formular Y=constant+B1*(X1)+B1*(X2)+...BnXn

After the analysis I realized it will cost the company 46,000 to produce 
1,200 800 1000 of product A, B and C respectively.
Frame 4 gives you the answer as #46,039
